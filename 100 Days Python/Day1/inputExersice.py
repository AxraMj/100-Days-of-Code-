# Inputs Instructions Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. 
# You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string. 
# Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

a=input("what is your name? ")
print(len(a))

#in one line we can add this
print(len(input("What is your pets name?")))
